The Dual Serial 232 Board (DS232 board) is a redesign of the Micro Innovations Dual Serial board that only requires 5 volts using modern MAX232 transceivers. The DS232, like the Dual Serial, adds two RS-232 ports to your ADAM computer in Slot 1 card.

The file ds232.jed is the JEDEC file required for programming the GAL16V8 chip on the DS232.

NOTE: The DS232 has not been fully tested or validated yet.
